Imagine a warehouse and some number of items in its inventory. We care only about the size of the
inventory, not the nature of the items. In particular, we care about maintaining the size of the
inventory correctly despite concurrent operations on it. The operations specifically are (1) adding a
single item to the inventory, and (2) removing a single item from the inventory.

Concepts such in concurrency, such as
threads, critical sections, and race conditions are used.
